    <p>How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. How do you prepare for gut punch? You can't, you just know in advance it's going to suck and just have to deal with it. For me, these analogies were ones I knew I had to appreciate as I started Mod 1 at Turing in order to best prepare and as I continue to progress. I had read plenty of the reviews prior to starting the program, and knew what I was getting into. Then again as I mentioned, you can really only prepare so much for a punch to the stomach. </p>
    <p>Prior to Turing, I had only a little amount of experience when it came to programming and web development and so I knew I would have to utilize other resources successfully in order to maximize my learning here. Besides my fellow classmates and the instructor staff, I found it to be very beneficial to have outside mentors to speak with and seek help from. It's been a great learning experience to have that extra resource and I know it's only going to increase in value during the later phases of training. Seeking the assistance of a mentor is something I would encourage any new student to proactively set up as they begin their program. If you don't want or have an outside mentor, there are plenty of helpful upper Mod students that are willing and eager to assist and you can set up as many channels as possible. It's highly recommended and it's only going to be of more benefit to you as a student. </p>
    <p>So far, my favorite technical concept has been the lectures on some of the enumerables and which ones can be powerful and effective tools depending on the situation you have. </p>
