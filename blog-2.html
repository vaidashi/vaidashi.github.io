    <p>How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. How do you prepare for gut punch? You can't, you just know in advance it's going to suck and just have to deal with it. For me, these analogies were ones I knew I had to appreciate as I started Mod 1 at Turing in order to best prepare and as I continue to progress. I had read plenty of the reviews prior to starting the program, and knew what I was getting into. Then again as I mentioned, you can really only prepare so much for a punch to the stomach. </p>
